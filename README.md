# k-sat-generation-and-solving
This program randomly generates k-SAT problems, and solves it using Hill Climbing, Beam search with width 3 and 4, and variable-neighborhood-descent with 3 neighborhood functions


The k-sat.py generates random K-sat problems
the 3-sat.py solves the problems via various algorithms.
